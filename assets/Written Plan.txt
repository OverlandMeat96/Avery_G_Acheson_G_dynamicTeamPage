For this assignment, We decided to make a traditional bio page to explain who we are and what we are doing on 
the project. We show the difference between our tasks and who is doing what on the project. We divided up the 
work to take advantage of our strong suits. Greg does the development and Gerrit does the design. In order to 
create the final bio page we used the same colour scheme as our final website. Each of the design choices were 
made with the final website in mind, the logo placement as well as the nav. The border matches the final website 
and encompasses everything in a uniform way. It also allows for us to add the borders on all of the photos of 
the site. The fonts also match the ones on the site for uniformity.
